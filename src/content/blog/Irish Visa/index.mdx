# <center> Introduction </center>

I have applied to Irish visa for my upcoming trip to Ireland at my
semester holiday's first week. I applied to visit family/friends visa
through VFS Global Beyoglu. In 4 weeks I got my visa valid for 3 months,
single entry. This blog post will be a guide on how to apply for Irish visa. [^1]

# <center> AVATS Form </center>

For any type of Irish visa, first you need to fill out an
[AVATS](https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx) (Automated
Visa Application and Tracking System) form. When you fill out an AVATS
it will give you a reference number and an Application Summary Form. The
reference number will be used while getting appointment from VFS Global.
The AVATS will ask you these things:

-   Reason for travel

-   Travel dates

-   Passport details

-   Current residence address

-   Do you have permission to return to the country after stay in
    Ireland

-   Have you ever applied and/or obtained Irish visa/preclearance

-   Visa refusals and other immigration related stuffs such as illegal
    staying

-   Any family member in Ireland (if yes, details)

-   Criminal Record

-   Past passports

-   If you are employed or student (with details)

-   Anyone you are going to travel with

-   Contact / host details (if no contact then hotel details)

Those answers will be kept in database for 30 days. The Application
Summary Form will be generated automatically from AVATS and must be
signed by you or your parents.

# <center> Other Documents </center>

For other documents you need to check your local visa application center
or embassy. For Turkey, VFS Global is the visa application center. You
can find which documents requested from this
[link](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/one-pager/Ireland/Turkey/english/pdf/familyfriend-new.pdf). [^2]

1.  Original Passport

    Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the intended
    date of departure from Ireland and at least 2 empty pages.

    A copy of all stamped or containing visa pages and biometric page is
    required.

2.  Previous Passports

    You should give all previous passports to the visa application
    officer with a copy of biometric page and other pages containing

    If you are employed, a signed letter from your employer
    If you are student, a document taken from your school or e-devlet
    showing you are student. (I guess the student IDs won't be accepted
    so get the document)

8.  Current Utility Account Bill

    If you are going to stay with your host, your host should give you
    their electricity or internet or any other utility bill in their
    name and showing their address.

    Generally 2 bills are okay.

    parents could take it from e-devlet on their name.

# <center> Appointment </center>

To get an appointment go to [VFS Global's website](https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/individuals/index.html). They will
request your reference number starting with "IRL". The AVATS will give
you a number without "IRL" prefix, but you can add the prefix and write
your reference number.

# <center> Waiting for Result </center>

Generally the processing times for touristic visas are 4 weeks. In this
time period you can check whether if your decision is made or not from
[this link](https://www.ireland.ie/en/turkiye/ankara/services/visas/weekly-decision-report/). At the link go to bottom and you will see 4 links to pdf files with 1
week interval. The pdf files contain only reference number and the
decision. If there is a decision, then you will receive your passport
within 1 to 2 weeks via UPS.
