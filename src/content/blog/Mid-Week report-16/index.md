## <center> Message from blogger </center>

Sorry for the huge gap between the reports. I was busy with my exams and I had to make a trip to Istanbul. To compensate for the gap, I will write a blog post about my trip to Istanbul, VFS Global experience, and one about my thoughts on a paradox/problem.
