## <center> I involved in a traffic accident

Today I involved in a traffic accident. Hopefully no one got injured seriously.

My course had finished and I packed up to go to city center. I had got out of the building and started to walk towards to bridge, which I would use if I weren't involved in a traffic accident.

There were 4 people ahead of me and I wanted to pass them. I was near a highway and there was an emergency lane which is 1,5 size of an average car. As soon as I had stepped on the lane from its closest point to sidewalk, A motorcycle which was coming from that lane hit to me. I don't remember what exactly happened after that but the first thing that I remember I stood up and checked myself. I talked a bit with the driver. 

After some time I went to the course building to find anyone else who can check me if I am alright and/or give me some sort of medical help such as disinfect the injuries. I was lucky. I saw a teacher still at the building. I had gone in to the building and as soon as I showed my hands, the teacher showed me a place to sit down. She gave me a cup of water first. After that she searched first aid kit stationed at the teachers room. She had gotten a bottle of tincture of iodine and applied it to the injuries in my palms, on my knees and elbows.

After I had called my mother and talked with her, with the teacher I went to taxi station. The teacher put me in a taxi and sent me to home.

Now I think that I may have been dragged on asphalt a bit. I think like that because my injuries does not look like something which can be happened by just falling straight to asphalt.

## <center> What is my status after 5 and half hours

Except little discomfort because of the jel we applied at home, I feel good.

1. [x] No respiration problem
2. [x] No nausea
3. [x] No dizziness
4. [x] No motor skills issue

So I think I didn't hit my head which is good for me.

## <center> What are my thoughts

Well if this event didn't happen then it would be much better for me. But it happened, and we cannot change that so no need to moan about it.

I learned that I should always check if someone is coming from a lane which supposed to be closed to traffic.

From now, I have a story to talk about it.
